# Student360 Analytics Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing student performance data from two subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese. The dashboard allows users to explore key performance metrics, such as average grade, pass rate, and improvement rate, as well as the impact of various factors like study time, absences, and parental support. The tool leverages Python, Dash, Plotly, and Machine Learning techniques to provide insights into student academic success.

## Features

- **Performance Metrics**: Displays the average grade, pass rate, and improvement rate across all students.
- **Grade Distribution**: Shows the distribution of grades across subjects using a histogram.
- **Impact Analysis**: Visualizes the correlation between different factors (e.g., study time, failures, support) and final grades.
- **Subject Comparison**: Compares average grades between Mathematics and Portuguese.
